                <p>This pie chart represents the distribution of Younghoe Koo’s field goal attempts with the Atlanta
                    Falcons, broken down by yardage intervals (0–39 yards, 40–49 yards, and 50+ yards). You can quickly
                    gauge where Koo is most frequently called upon to kick by illustrating the proportion of attempts
                    from each distance. Whether short-range tries or high-pressure long-distance attempts, the chart
                    provides a visual snapshot of the variety and scope of Koo’s responsibilities on the field.</p>

                <p>Analyzing the spread of yard ranges highlights Koo’s adaptability and the Falcons’ reliance on his
                    leg in varied situations. For instance, if a significant slice of the chart represents 40-yard-plus
                    attempts, it underscores the coaching staff’s confidence in his ability to deliver from greater
                    distances. The distribution also offers insights into how the team strategizes around field position
                    and scoring opportunities, making Koo’s reliability across multiple ranges all the more valuable for
                    securing essential points.</p>
